I don't often find personal sites useful, as my thoughts are still shallow.
This site's existence is due to the coincidence of this delightful
domain name and the somewhat obligated personal site requirement of a
computer science student and a programmer.

Of course [Github](https://github.com/RuneBlaze) would serve as a rough
indication of my programming activities. I also [sell music](https://ceremonial.itch.io/horror-prelude) while enjoying in a [love-hate
relationship](https://thwiki.cc/疯帽子茶会) in the Touhou doujin music scene.
